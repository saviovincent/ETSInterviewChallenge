 Pre-Interview Code Sample
 
Many details for the following assignments have been left intentionally vague. Follow the principle of least surprise in making reasonable decisions regarding the implementation. While this is a trivial assignment, pretend that this is production code. Take whatever measures you feel are required for your code to meet this bar. We are not concerned with how quickly you complete this assignment. Take your time and “do it right.”

Deck of Cards
52 cards with:
● 4 suits:  hearts ,  spades ,  clubs ,  diamonds
● Face values of:  Ace ,  2-10 ,  Jack ,  Queen , and  King ). Within one of your classes, you must provide two operations:
shuffle()  - shuffle returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being randomly permuted
dealOneCard()  -  returns one card from the deck to the caller. Specifically, a call to shuffle()  followed by 52 calls to  dealOneCard()  should result in the caller being provided all 52 cards of the deck in a random order. If the caller then makes a 53rd call dealOneCard(),  no card is dealt.
